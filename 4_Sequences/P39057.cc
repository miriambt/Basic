/* Computing areas 
Reads several descriptions of rectangles and circles, and for each one prints its corresponding area.

Input: begins with a number n, followed by n descriptions. If of a rectangle, we have the word “rectangle” followed by two strictly positive real numbers: its length and its width. If of a circle, we have the word “circle” followed by a strictly positive real number: its radius.
