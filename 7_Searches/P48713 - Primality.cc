/* Primality
Write a program that reads a sequence of natural numbers and, for each one, tells if it is a prime number or not. Remember that a natural number is prime if and only if it is greater than 1 and it does not have any positive divisor other than 1 and itself.

Input

Input consists of a number n, followed by n natural numbers.

Output

For every given natural number, tell in a line if it is prime or not, following the format of the example.

Hint

For every given n, at most about âˆšn  steps are needed to know if it is prime or not.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
	int n;
	cin >> n;

	for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c) {
		int p;
		cin >> p;

		bool is_prime = true;
		int i = 2;
		while (is_prime and i*i <= p) {
			if (p%i == 0) is_prime = false;
			++i;
		}

		if (p > 1 and is_prime) cout << p << " is prime" << endl;
		else cout << p << " is not prime" << endl;
	}
}


/* 
Example:
Input: 4
7 10 101 161
Output:
7 is prime
10 is not prime
101 is prime
161 is not prime
